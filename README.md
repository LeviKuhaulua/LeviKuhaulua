## Introduction

My name is Levi Kuhaulua and I am a student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and was a former student at Hawaiʻi Pacific University from 2022-2024. I am currently studying Computer Science at UH and am looking to get a career in Full-Stack Web Development. As of right now, I am working at my former middle school as a Multimedia Center Technician where I am in charge of running and maintaining all things relating to eSports and I work at my former high school as well as a tutor for the AVID program (program that helps prepare students - particularly first-generation - for college).
